X1 (LEO): human spaceflight / Earth observation; frequent revisits, moderate global coverage
X2 (MEO): GNSS constellation-style navigation; near 12-hour period gives repeating ground tracks
X3 (Molniya): long dwell over high northern latitudes—ideal for comms and ISR in high-lat regions
X4 (GEO): continuous coverage over a fixed longitude—telecom, weather, and broadcast
